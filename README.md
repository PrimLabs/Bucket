# Bucket

The library is a **storage library** for canisters to manage Stable Memory. 

As far as we know, canisters that storage data into stable memory have many advantages, such as :
- upgradable (when rts memory goes large)
- larger storage space : Stable Memory can be allocated to 8 GB as present
- no GC cost

Therefore, In order to be compatible with the existing development ecology, we develop two versions :

- [Bucket](#Bucket)
- [Bucket-HTTP](#Bucket-HTTP)

You can use this as simple as using the TireMap.

##  Bucket

<span id="prework"></span>

- First, you need to import Bucket in your project 

   ```motoko
   import Bucket "Bucket";
   ```

- Second, you need to declare a Bucket

   **upgrade** ：This means that you can upgrade your canister without discarding files stored in the stablememory. Meanwhile available stablememory will become **aval_stablememory** = **8G - heap memory**
   
   ```motoko
   let bucket = Bucket.Bucket(true); // true : upgradable, false : unupgradable
   ```

   You have a few more things to do below: 

   1. you should use a stable entries to store your key-value pairs during upgrade

      ```motoko
      stable var bucket_entries: [(Text,[(Nat64, Nat)])] = [];
      ```

   2. You also need to configure the system function [preupgrade and postupgrade](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/language-guide/upgrades.html#_preupgrade_and_postupgrade_system_methods)

      ```motoko
          system func preupgrade(){
              bucket_entries := bucket.preupgrade();
          };
      
          system func postupgrade(){
              bucket.postupgrade(bucket_entries);
              bucket_entries := [];
          };
      ```
      
  
  **nonupgradable** : This means that if you upgrade your canister, you will discard files stored in the stablememory
  ```motoko
  let bucket = Bucket.Bucket(false); // true : upgradable, false : nonupgradable
  ```


- Third,configure the **dfx.json**

  you should point out how much stable memory pages you want to use in dfx.json(recommendation : 131072)

  ```motoko
  "build" :{
     "args": "--max-stable-pages=131072" // the max size is 131072 [131072 = 8G / 64KB(each page size)]
  }
  ```

**[more details please read the demo](https://github.com/PrimLabs/Bucket/blob/main/src/Bucket/example.mo)**

###  API

- **put** ：put the value into stablememory,use key to index

  ​            if you add it again with the same key, it will overwrite the previous file

  ```motoko
  public func put(key: Text, value : Blob): Result.Result<(), Error>
  ```

  tips: you can transform any type T to Text by using ``debug_show(t: T)``

- **append** ：put the value into stablememory,use key to index

  ​                    if added again with the same key, it will be merged with the previous file block

  ```motoko
  public func append(key: Text, value : Blob): Result.Result<(), Error>
  ```

  tips: you can transform any type T to Text by using ``debug_show(t: T)``

- **get** : use the key to get the value

  ```motoko
  public func get(key: Text): Result.Result<[Blob], Error>
  ```

- **preupgrade** : return entries

  ```motoko
  public func preupgrade(): [(Text, [(Nat64, Nat)])]
  ```

- **postupgrade**

  ```motoko
  public func postupgrade(entries : [(Text, [(Nat64, Nat)])]): ()
  ```

<span id="Bucket-HTTP"></span>

##  Bucket-HTTP

The difference between Bucket-HTTP and Bucket is that Bucket-HTTP has built-in **http_request**, so people can query files through example : **canisterID.raw.ic0.app/static/key**

example

```
https://2fli5-jyaaa-aaaao-aabea-cai.raw.ic0.app/static/0
```

Due to the problem of IC mainnet, HTTP-StreamingCallback cannot work at present, so only files less than or equal to **3M** can be accessed through http.

**We will fix this deficiency as soon as possible.**

[**The preparation is almost the same as the above, just change Bucket to Bucket-HTTP**](#prework)

  ```motoko
  public func get(key: Text): Result.Result<[Blob], Error>
  ```

- **build_http** : Pass in the function that parses the key in the url,the key is used to get the value

  ATTENTION : YOU MUST SET YOUR DECODE FUNCITON OR REWRITE IT AND CALL THE BUILD FUNCTION TO ENABLE IT WHEN YOU NEED TO USE THE HTTP INTERFACE.

  ```motoko
  public func build_http(fn_: DecodeUrl): ()
  ```

  ```motoko
  public type DecodeUrl = (Text) -> (Text);
  ```

- **http_request**

  ```motoko
  public func http_request(request: HttpRequest): HttpResponse
  ```

- **preupgrade** : return entries

  ```motoko
  public func preupgrade(): [(Text, [(Nat64, Nat)])]
  ```

- **postupgrade**

  ```motoko
  public func postupgrade(entries : [(Text, [(Nat64, Nat)])]): ()
  ```
